### ⭐ _growing and connecting, one line at a time_ ⭐

_Oh hello there! I'm Greshka and welcome to my GitHub!_

_You probably have a million questions right now, but let me start with the big one: who am I?_

## 🥜 me in a nutshell 
- I study at Auckland University of Technology (AUT) towards a Bachelor of Computer and Information Science, Software Development major, Computer Science minor; I graduate at the end of 2025 👩🏻‍🎓
- After university, I hope to pursue a career in software engineering or web development 💻
- My passion for software started with a curiosity to know what goes on inside the computers that are rapidly evolving to support and simplify our daily lives, and now continues to be a motivation for me.
- My hobbies include refereeing basketball games, learning about my Catholic faith, going to the gym and watching movies 🫶🏻

_Nice to meet you! I bet the first thing you want to explore here are my projects. So far, these repositories derive from university assignments to show my growth in my development journey! Let me outline a few of my favourites:_

## 👓 projects
- [Chronomancy](https://github.com/greshh/Chronomancy) - A platformer game built with Java
- [A 3D Graphics Scene](https://github.com/greshh/3DGraphicsScene) - A Java program that generates a 3D graphics scene comprising of planar and spherical surfaces, unleashing creativity with what can be created with these two types of surfaces.
- [Big Integer Addition](https://github.com/greshh/BigIntegerAddition) - a C++ program that adds large positive integers (too big for standard types), using stack-based implementation.

_I hope you see a lot of my growth from this. Speaking of growth, you may be asking what is my **"catchphrase"** about?_

## ☁️ what i believe in
One fun fact to know about me: I am a continuous learner. This isn't just academically (through university) or spiritually (my Catholic faith), but even in the most mundane situations in my life; I believe that every situation in my life has at least one learning experience and gives me a chance to better myself. And from here, I love to <ins>**grow**</ins>, knowing that I can look back at younger Greshka five years ago and give her something to learn from my own experiences. 

And with this, I want to give back. My motivation for learning software development is knowing that I can put this to good use and create software that can benefit others, whether this would help a single client, a certain group or even an entire population. I strive to create software that help individuals <ins>**connect**</ins> with each other to live towards a happier future. 

And being someone very detail-oriented, my career goal is to achieve all this through clean code - <ins>**one line at a time**</ins>.

_Well, that is me for now! Leave a follow here and on my socials if you want to come along on this journey with me. I'm happy to chat and connect about collaborating or suggesting potential project ideas :)_
